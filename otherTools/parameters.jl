using Primes

# These primes are good example primes, as they have p = Â±4 (mod 9), so taking cube roots is easy in F_p^2
plist = [5, 13, 23, 31, 41, 59, 67]
bigplist = [big(2)^107 - 1, big(2)^521 - 1]

# The prime used in the OG SIDH paper. Does not have above property^
OGp = big(2)^63*big(3)^41*11-1

# If p = 2 (mod 3) we have an easy supersingular curve
# E = Affine_EC_TwiHes(F, inv(4*one(F)), zero(F))
# Or twisted to
# E = Affine_EC_TwiHes(F, sqrt(F(b))*inv(4*one(F)), zero(F))
# This is isomorphic to the Weierstrass curve y^2 = x^3 + 1

# Similarly (slightly worse though) If p = 3 (mod 4) we have an easy supersingular curve
# y^2 = x^3 - x
# Translating this to twisted Hessian form will be future work

# If p = 1 (mod 12), just run away, dont look back.


#Scratch all this, much easier than that...
#If p = 2 (mod 3), then 0 is a supersingular j-invariant
#If p = 3 (mod 4), then 1728 is a supersingular j-invariant
